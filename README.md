## Back-end
### Crawler/Indexing Engine 
- The back-end module which takes a page next in line to be indexed, reads the content of the page, parses it into words, and updates the database as specified in the previous section. (Note that it will need to update tables page, word, and page_word, but not search.) For each page slated to be indexed, one also collect additional URLs to be indexed (by looking through it for “href” attributes). This somewhat akin to a “breadth first search”.
